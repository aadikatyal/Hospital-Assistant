# Hospital Assistant

Hack The Northeast (HTNE) hackathon submission. With COVID-19 raging across the globe, I created an Android application to aid patients in receiving the fastest medical care. Patients can search for closeby hospitals and see whether or not it is taking COVID-19 patients. I implemented Google Places API (healthcare locations in 50 mile radius), SMTP server, Google Firebase Authentication (login/verification email), Real-time database (user login info), and Storage (patient photos). Gained proficiency in public APIs in Java and the Android Studio IDE.
